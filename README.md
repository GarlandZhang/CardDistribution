# SimpleShuffle

Description: this is done by measuring how distributed their cards are for each shuffle type. In particular, there are 4 shuffle types (some of the most popular shuffles) studied in this program: Riffle shuffle, Hindu shuffle, Overhand shuffle, Pile shuffle (simply stack cards on top of each other). 

Tools/Frameworks/APIs: The GUI was created using JFrame. The end product included: buttons, text input, and text fields. To create the math algorithms to determine expected overall distribution and deviations in shuffles, I used the Apache Commons Library for Standard Deviation. 

Reflection: This is by far the most ambitious project I had, as it delved into a topic that is not commonly studied and is unique. I thoroughly enjoyed building this as it was one of my first coding projects.
