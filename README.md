# SimpleShuffle

Description: A Java program that provides an accurate analysis on a user's shuffling abilities; this is done by meashuring how distributed their cards are for each shuffle type. In particular, there are 4 shuffle types (some of the most popular shuffles) studied in this program: Riffle shuffle, Hindu shuffle, Overhand shuffle, Pile shuffle (simply stack cards on top of each other). 

Tools/Frameworks/APIs: The GUI was created using JFrame. The end product included: buttons, text input, and text fields.

Reflection: This is by far the most productive project I had, as it delved into a topic that is not commonly studied and is unique. I thoroughly enjoyed building this as it was one of my first coding projects.
